#Simple webcrawler in php

This is my first attempt at a simple webcrawler in php.

The crawler uses curl to fetch webpages. A callback is called by the crawler for all webpages to let the caller do whatever with the page. In this project the callback does a simple search.

The code is commented and is not difficult to read if you want to play around with it.

The license is public domain. Do whatever you like.
